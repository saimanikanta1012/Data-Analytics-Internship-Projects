# Used Bike Prices Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing used bike price data to understand the key factors that influence resale value.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to identify trends and patterns in bike pricing.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Analyze used bike prices
- Identify factors affecting resale value such as bike age, mileage, engine power, ownership history, and model popularity

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information related to used bikes, including:
- Model Name
- Model Year
- Bike Age
- Mileage
- Engine Power
- Owner Type
- Location
- Price

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The following data cleaning steps were performed:
- Handled missing and inconsistent values carefully to avoid data loss
- Converted necessary columns to appropriate data types
- Avoided aggressive row removal to preserve meaningful data

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
- Created **Bike Age** from model year
- Grouped mileage and engine power into meaningful ranges for better analysis
- Selected top bike models and locations for clearer visual interpretation

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
- Distribution of used bike prices
- Average price variation with bike age
- Price comparison across mileage ranges
- Price distribution by engine power categories
- Average resale price by owner type
- Top bike models by average resale price

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Most used bikes fall into the low to mid-price range
- Bike prices decrease as bike age increases
- Fuel-efficient bikes tend to have better resale value
- Higher engine power is associated with higher prices
- First-owner bikes command higher resale prices
- Certain bike models retain higher resale value consistently

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Some features had missing values and were excluded from analysis
- The analysis is exploratory and does not include price prediction
- Market dynamics and external factors are not considered

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Build a machine learning model to predict bike prices
- Include additional features such as service history
- Perform time-series analysis on price trends

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills by cleaning real-world data, creating meaningful features, and generating insights through visualization.  
The findings can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used bike market.
